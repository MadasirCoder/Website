            Note: This application was developed using my family rules which differ from other monopoly rules. The new rules don&#39;t change the game too much. The list of rules are at the bottom of the page.

            1) If a player lands on the Income Tax or Super Tax tile, he/she needs to put the tax money on the free parking.<br />
            2) If a player lands on the Free Parking Tile, he/she will collect the whatever money lying there at that period.<br />
            3) There&#39;s no Auctions in this game. If a player doesn&#39;t want to buy the property, then the game simply moves to the next players turn to roll the dice.<br />
            4) The &quot;Get out of Jail Free Card&quot; simply adds 50 cash to the players account.<br />
            5) If a player goes to jail, he/she can pay 50 cash to get out rather than waiting 3 turns.<br />
            6) Taking down a property gives you full value. For example, taking down Mayfair Hotel will give you 2,000 cash.&nbsp;&nbsp;
